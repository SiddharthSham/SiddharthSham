# Hey there! 👋

### Who am I?
I'm a creative developer who is passionate about motion and interaction design, and I specialise in writing highly performant animations using JavaScript. I am also interested in data science research, specifically in the field of Natural Language Processing.

### What am I doing now?
Learning WebGL / ThreeJS, with physics based animations. Hit me up to rant about vertex shaders :P

### What can I do for you?
I'm currently a Fellow at Major League Hacking, but I'm open to freelancing on exciting and innovative projects, preferably with a social impact.
