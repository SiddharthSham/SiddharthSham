# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a creative developer who is passionate about motion and interaction design. I specialise in writing highly performant animations using JavaScript, and I'm currently learning about WebGL with ThreeJS, along with physics based animations. I am also interested in data science research, specifically in the field of Natural Language Processing.


I'm currently a Fellow at Major League Hacking, but I'm open to freelancing on exciting and innovative projects, preferably with a social impact.
